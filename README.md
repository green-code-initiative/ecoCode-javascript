Websites are becoming increasingly heavy and complex over the years. They represent an important part
of the digital environmental footprint. The objective of this project is to detect smells in a website source code
that can have a negative ecological impact: overconsumption of energy, "fatware", shortening of the life span of
devices, etc. This project is part of [Creedengo](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode) (previously ecoCode).

Rules in this repository are mainly based from book
[115 Web Ecodesign Best Practices](https://github.com/cnumr/best-practices).
This reference is maintained by [CNumR](https://collectif.greenit.fr/), a french collective that works
for a responsible design of digital services. You can find all applicable rules in the [RULES.md file](RULES.md).

## üåø SonarQube plugin

_Creedengo_ JavaScript is an "eco-responsibility" static code analyzer for projects based on the JavaScript ecosystem. It
can handle JavaScript, TypeScript and all frameworks that use them. Its main purpose is to work with website source
code, but it can also analyze back-end code.

This project proposes rules for the following technologies:

- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- NestJS
- React (JSX)
- React Native / Expo

## üîß ESLint plugin

This project uses an internal ESLint plugin to analyze your source code.

If you are not using SonarQube, we have a solution for you: the linter is working nicely on its own! \
Follow instructions in the [dedicated README file](eslint-plugin/README.md) to use it as a standalone plugin.
